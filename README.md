### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm a self-taught, results-driven programmer currently working on Azure at Microsoft.  
In my free time, I'm either creating or reverse engineering games.  

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things, if it gets me closer to an end-goal.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always happy to get help on any of my projects, but no pressure!
